### Reflection

I don't have much to say here about writing the code itself. I appreciate 
this assignment because one of my tasks for my capstone (coming up 
next quarter) is to programmatically generate Arduino code for a 
generated FSM; I feel like that particular part of the project is 
much more tractable now!

Also, I would like to say thank you for teaching this class and doing 
a fantastic job of it. It was a pleasure taking it with you!
