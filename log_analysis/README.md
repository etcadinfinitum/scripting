# Assignment 3: Log Analysis

By Lizzy Presland

Created for CSS 390; [assignment description is here.](http://courses.washington.edu/css390/2019-q4/assignment-03.html)

## Included Files

* `compare.py`: The script which produces the report.
* `make_data.py`: A script which produces test data.
* `test-report.txt`: The sample report generated from test data.
* `test-evaluator-baseline.log`: The baseline file of test data.
* `test-evaluator.log`: The new file which is to be compared against the baseline.

## Code Style & Quality

I have no doubt that some of the techniques in my scripts could be 
improved upon. I try to maintain readability and comprehension for my 
own sake, and for the time being, that includes forgoing operations 
which may be more compact and Pythonic in favor of more familiar 
constructs. I would be curious to know what you think.

I did enjoy digging further into set operations in Python, namely the 
union, intersection, and difference operators.

## Test Data Generation

A script is included for data generation, along with a set of sample 
files for you to use. The script is more heavy-handed in record 
modification than the test data provided for the assignment, and 
includes deleting cookies and adding new ones.
